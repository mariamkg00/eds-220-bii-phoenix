    "The purpose of this analysis is to visually highlight areas within Phoenix have since lost BII values of greater than or equal to 0.75. \n",

    "As urbanization increasingly becomes prevalent in different areas, land cover changes then affects biodiversity of a given area. According to the USDA (US Department of Agriculture), \"urban expansion may\n",
    "lead to fragmentation, potentially resulting in genetic or demographic isolation of native species \"(Ricketts 2001). It can be argued that urbanization can affect biodiversity and ecosystems in direct and indirect ways. Direct impacts of urbanization range anywhere from habitat loss to modified soils due to land transformation. Biodiversity is an important focal point of research because it contributes to priceless ecosystem services that cannot be replaced or replenished once depleted. It is important to take note at the loss in order to prevent further loss from occurring. \n",

    "According to Microsoft Planetary Computer (MPC), biodiversity intactness is a combination of two measurements : \n",
    "- the quantity of individuals\n",
    "- Compositional Similarity (how similar the composition of species is to an intact baseline)"
